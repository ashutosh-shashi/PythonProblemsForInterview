# Python Problems for Interview

This repository contains Python programs based on the problems from the Python interview book. Each chapter from the book has its own folder, and the files within these folders follow a specific naming convention to indicate the problem number, approach, and any follow-up problems.

## Folder Structure

- `chap-1/` : Contains programs for Chapter 1
- `chap-2/` : Contains programs for Chapter 2
- `chap-3/` : Contains programs for Chapter 3
- ...

## File Naming Convention

The files are named using the following convention:

- `prob<problem_number>.py` : Indicates the main problem.
    - Example: `prob16.py` is for Problem 16.

- `prob<problem_number>a<approach_number>.py` : Indicates the main problem and approach.
    - Example: `prob1a1.py` is for Problem 1 with Approach 1.

- `prob<problem_number>a<approach_number>-<follow_up_number>.py` : Indicates a follow-up problem related to the main problem and approach.
    - Example: `prob1a1-1.py` is for the first follow-up problem related to Problem 1 with Approach 1.
